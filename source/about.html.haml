          Flathub aims to be the place to get and distribute apps for Linux. It is powered by
          =succeed " which allows Flathub apps to run on almost any Linux distribution." do
            =link_to "Flatpak", "https://flatpak.org/"
        %p
          If you are a Linux user, you can use Flathub to gain access to a growing collection of Flatpak applications. App developers
          =succeed "to be distributed to Flathub's growing user base, thus providing a single gateway to the entire Linux desktop ecosystem." do
            =link_to "can submit their applications ", "https://github.com/flathub/flathub/wiki/App-Submission"
        %p
          At the moment, applications must either be legally redistributable or be available as a third party download. However, if you are a proprietary app developer and are interested in using Flathub, we would love to talk to you.
