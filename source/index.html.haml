            Flathub is a build and distribution service for Flatpak applications. Its goal is to act as a central hub for making desktop applications available to users.

          To download and install applications from Flathub, you will need to install Flatpak (if you haven't already) and then add the repository in one of two ways:

        %h2#using Using Flathub in GNOME Software
        %p
          If you are on Arch, Debian Stretch (or later), Endless OS, Fedora 25 (or later), Mageia 6 (or later), or OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, you can 
          = link_to "download", "https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo"
          the repository file and use GNOME Software to install it.

        %h2#using Using Flathub on the Command Line
        %p
          From the command line, run: 

        %pre
          :preserve
            <span class="unselectable">$ </span>flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

        %p
          You can then browse and install applications in the normal manner. See the Flatpak
